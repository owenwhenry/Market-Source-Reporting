# Market-Source-Reporting
Custom report generation script based on CRS digital attribution data.

This script uses PyODBC and Pandas to connect to two databases and generate some basic graphs and reporting.

Eventually, the goal is to add the ability to generate full reports based on the data via Jinja. 

Current version is highly specific to my database context, working on refactoring to make it more generally usable. 

Happy coding!
