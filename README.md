# Market-Source-Reporting
Custom report generation script based on CRS digital attribution data.

This script uses PyODBC and Pandas to connect to two databases and generate some basic graphs and reporting.

Eventually, the goal is to add the ability to generate PDF's based on the data. 

Although this script is for a specific context, it should be usable for anyone who needs to join data in multiple databases and then run summary reports on it.
